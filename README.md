# Portfolio Website
This repo is for building a portfolio website with React, CSS, JS
Visit  [angkondeb.netlify.app](https://angkondeb.netlify.app/) in Laptop/PC

Issues: Some images need to be reduced in size. But it works just fine without that.

# Design Inspiration 
   You can view this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/eCmKMRZ8X09HWVnIsxKGBM/WhiteProto?m=auto&t=BDZZm5mGt6b1FGkI-1) file

## Reuse Guide
1. Install Node js in your PC 
   You can use this [Link](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Open VS Code and new folder then Install Vite+  React+ Javascript:
   
   ```npm install vite@latest ./```
3. Use React > JavaScript and follow instructions.
4. Then install fonts:
   
   ```npm install @fontsource/<fontName>```
   
   For Example:
   
   ```npm install @fontsource/poppins```
   
   You can look at [fontsource](https://fontsource.org/)

   I have used:

   ```npm install @fontsource/baloo-2 @fontsource/poppins @fontsource/press-start-2p @fontsource-variable/jaro @fontsource-variable/sixtyfour```
5. You need to import this fonts. Delete the **Public** folder.
6. Replace folders and files of your working-folder with the repository files and folders.
7. To run the website use dev mode:

   ```npm run dev```

8. Fix the errors if any.
10. Customize as necessary.
10. If everything is OK. close all npm dev by pressing ctrl + C and Run:

    ```npm run build```
   
11. Then check via:

    ```npm run preview```

12. There will be folder called **dist**
13. If npm run preview works fine then upload it to netlify.com
14. You have to upload only the **dist** folder.
15. You can change domain or the name. If domain is not purchased there will be .netlify.app extension in your web address.
